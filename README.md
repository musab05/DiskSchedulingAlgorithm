# Disk Scheduling Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of various disk scheduling algorithms in Java. Disk scheduling algorithms are used by operating systems to manage the order in which disk I/O requests are processed. Efficient scheduling can significantly improve the performance of the system.

## Overview

Disk scheduling algorithms determine the order in which disk access requests are serviced. In this project, we have implemented several well-known disk scheduling algorithms in Java.

## Algorithms Implemented

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- Elevator (SCAN)
- Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)
- LOOK
- C-LOOK
